# Machine Learning (Coursera)
This is my solution to all the programming assignments and quizzes of Machine-Learning (Coursera) taught by Andrew Ng. After completing this course you will get a broad idea of Machine learning algorithms. Try to solve all the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere then feel free to browse the code.

## Contents
* Lectures Slides
>This are slides professor used. You can directly download updated slides from coursera itself.


* Solution to programming assignment
>This are solutions for the programming. I have updated the version problem issue. So its final code as of Jan 2022. 
>>To use this you need to install matlab in your pc. And then use the instruction as given in coursera tutorial. No need to change anything unless questions are changed.
>>If any problem arises then delete the token file from programming folder and try submitting again. 


* Solution to Quizzes
>Some questions of quizzes are changed and updated so this will be not that useful. I reccommend to use a this site https://www.apdaga.com for answers.
